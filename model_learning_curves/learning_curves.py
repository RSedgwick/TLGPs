## A general script for running learning curves on the hpc. should be able to specify the test type, the seed and the
## number of data points. The script should fit each of the models with multiple inits for multiple random restarts and
# save the lml and rsme and nlpd for every restart. It should also have the option to plot the predictions of each
# model and save outside the repo.
